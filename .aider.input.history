+Thank you. This application isn't registering the keycodes within the application, though.

+The application still isn't registering keys like 'k', 'j', and 'q' within the TUI session.

+Thanks, this is worth committing! Afterwards, could we try integrating the progressive speedup feature as well?

+y

# 2025-01-03 11:55:20.561250
+So I made a few adjustments to the UI and incorporated the `run_progressive_metronome` feature into the app. Could you please add a pause feature that either pauses or resumes the metronome when the space bar is pressed?

# 2025-01-03 11:56:13.116528
+n

# 2025-01-03 12:06:55.400233
+So the space bar isn't updating the bpm or the ui currently.

+n

# 2025-01-03 12:11:05.810188
+This is much better, thank you! However, the "[PAUSED]" text update only flashes on the screen before being written over on the next cycle.

# 2025-01-04 14:24:47.288926
+Could you please refactor main.rs into smaller modules and functions with a focus on smart abstractions?
